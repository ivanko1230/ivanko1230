This is **Ivan** from Ukraine.

I am a **full-stack web & mobile developer** utilizing JavaScript/Typescript, React, React Native, Node, GraphQL, and AWS.

I was first exposed to the basics of programming at the University with my first exposure consisting of simple Object-Oriented Programming Concepts for homework.

Currently working at a mobile and web development. - I ultimately love to work on projects where I can utilize my skills to help implement creative solutions.

Thank you for viewing my profile!
